First, to clone the project, you need to launch the project. The initial commands are as follows:

1. npm install â€“ this will install the packages I have used, which are listed in the package.json.
2. To run the project, use the command npm start.
   Once the project is running, you need to create a category by entering the name you want for that category. After creating the category, you must select it to reveal the button that allows you to create a note within that category. You can create a note by filling in the inputs for the title and the content of the note.

Additionally, there is a search input where, if you have created several notes in a category, you can search for a note by the title you assigned to it. You can also update any note you have saved, and you can delete a note by using the "Delete Note" button.
